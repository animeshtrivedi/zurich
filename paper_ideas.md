#### The implementation of the Cilk-5 multithreaded language.

This is one my favourite papers
([pdf](http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/cilk5.pdf)), and I think it's not
very well known.  It talks about expressing parallel progarms and buidling a
run-time system that efficiently executes them, and combines a strong
theoretical background with practical concerns. It won the [2008 Most
Influential PLDI Paper
Award](http://www.sigplan.org/Awards/PLDI/#2008_Matteo_Frigo__Charles_E._Leiserson__and_Keith_H._Randall).
